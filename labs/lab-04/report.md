Free software follows 4 freedoms, which essentially lets you do anything with the software (run it, study it, modify it, redistribute it).

### 3
It's important to choose a license because you can specify what users can do with the software that you are licensing. Some licenses allow you to
modify and then make the software closed-source, while others require you to keep modified versions open source. 

### 4
It is important to avoid using projects that don't have an explicit license, because this entails that the owner of the source code can sue those
who use it in the future. Even if the source code is released onto Github, if there is no explicit license, then it is treated as copyrighted
work. This can create a lot of problems even if the source code was intended to be open source, and so we should avoid projects that do not
include a license in their source code.

### 5
I agree with the claim where Gopher did not follow the open systems model. The software itself was open source, while the communication standards
were not. The Gopher team chose the path that Gopher was to go, instead of letting the open source community decide what was the best route. This
was a leading factor to the downfall of Gopher, the underutilization of the open source community made the software obsolete as people adopted
http.

The Android and Linux kernel both use the GNU GPL v2 license, and the Android kernel uses GNU GPL v2 because it is based on the Linux kernel, and so the license must be the same.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system) As for the Linux kernel, Torvalds wanted commercial redistribution, he wanted the code to be shared when redistributed after modification, and GNU GPL v2 satisfied those requirements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux It also follows the four freedoms https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/celebrating-30-years-linux-kernel-and-gplv2. Linus also mentions why he doesn't transition to GPL v3 here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU&ab_channel=TFiR, but to begin with, there are parts of the code that are owned by others that would need approval to transition to GPL v3 other than Torvalds himself.
