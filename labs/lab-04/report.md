It's important to choose a license because you can specify what users can do with the software that you are licensing. Some licenses allow you to
modify and then make the software closed-source, while others require you to keep modified versions open source. 

### 4
It is important to avoid using projects that don't have an explicit license, because this entails that the owner of the source code can sue those
who use it in the future. Even if the source code is released onto Github, if there is no explicit license, then it is treated as copyrighted
work. This can create a lot of problems even if the source code was intended to be open source, and so we should avoid projects that do not
include a license in their source code.

### 5
I agree with the claim where Gopher did not follow the open systems model. The software itself was open source, while the communication standards
were not. The Gopher team chose the path that Gopher was to go, instead of letting the open source community decide what was the best route. This
was a leading factor to the downfall of Gopher, the underutilization of the open source community made the software obsolete as people adopted
http.
