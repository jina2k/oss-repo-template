2.1</br>
The 10 criteria listed in [Open Source Definition](http://opensource.org/osd) define open source, which is summarized below:

Source code must be included in a way that it can be easily modifiable by a programmer and free to use. Those redistributing the software have to abide by the license, where the license also allows other developers to modify the source code, so long as the modified source code is kept under the same license terms. The license also must not allow discrimination of any kind (ie; race or what the software will be used for). </br>
Further definitions defined in the url describe other rules for the license to follow, mostly talking about allowing freedom with the source code when interacting with other software/licenses. 

2.2</br>
Eric Raymond's article [Smart Questions - How to ask the question The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) describes how to ask questions the smart way,
talking about how nowadays developers don't seem to put in the effort to read before asking. Many times on the Internet, more often nowadays, there are often people (not just developers) who ask a question without regard to if it was previously asked 5 minutes ago, or if the answer could be easily found in a 5 second Google search. The instantaneous sending of a message to the Internet allows for people to do this, and so there is reason to believe a question can be answered quickly after being asked. However, the other side of this is where the person answering is not monitoring chat forums 24/7, and in fact an answer can be found faster searching rather than by asking most of the time. In other words, Eric Raymond goes on to talk about asking questions that haven't already been answered. </br>
In general, Googling is a skill that is necessary for being a developer. Finding what you are looking for through key phrases and critically thinking about answers given on forums,
whilst also filtering through multiple answers is a skill that developers need to perform well. Of course, if the question you're asking is so abstract that you can't find a 
related answer on the Internet, it could be that you are asking the wrong question. Lastly, if you have to ask a question, try to describe it with enough information so that
the person on the other side can understand maybe half of what is being asked, instead of just copy-pasting your code and asking why it doesn't work.

2.3 (How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way)</br>
- Allow critical thinking for the person asking the question, by giving them a general solution. At times, the person asking a question is asking for a very specific scenario with a very specific answer. However, there are times when there is no 1 way to go about the problem, so answering a question with a general solution in a way that causes the person asking to think about the answer will help not just the person asking, but also people who visit the forums in the future.

- Explain your solution. This can reference documentation, other forums, code, etc. By explaining your code, the user can try to understand the why, and therefore reduces the number of questions being asked in the future.
