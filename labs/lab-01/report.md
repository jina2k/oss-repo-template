The 10 criteria listed in https://opensource.org/osd define open source, which is summarized below:

Source code must be included in a way that it can be easily modifiable by a programmer and free to use. Those redistributing the software have to abide by the license, where the license also allows other developers to modify the source code, so long as the modified source code is kept under the same license terms. The license also must not allow discrimination of any kind (ie; race or what the software will be used for). 
</br> Further definitions defined in the url describe other rules for the license to follow, mostly talking about allowing freedom with the source code when interacting with other software/licenses.
